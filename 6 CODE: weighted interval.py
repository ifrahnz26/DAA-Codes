'''A drama venue needs to be allocated for different drama school 
requests such that maximum profit is obtained for the company 
owning the drama venue. The requests are shown in the table 
with startâ€“time, finish-time and the amount affordable by the drama school. 
Design and implement Weighted Interval Scheduling algorithm 
such that maximum profit is obtained for the company owning 
the drama venue using Dynamic programming principles. 
State the design strategy used and comment on 
the time complexity of the same
